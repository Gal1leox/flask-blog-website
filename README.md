# ✍️Personal Blog Website

## I believe a typical social media platform has a number of negative aspects:
- People are distracted by ads.
- People waste time checking random user profiles.
- People check the likes on their posts. If someone doesn’t like a post, it may damage the friendship.
- People measure social status by the number of views, likes and subscriptions.

In addition, people often open social media unintentionally and are immediately flooded with new posts. <br />
It can take hours to scroll down to the very last post.

### To make a long story short:
Big companies do their best to keep users stuck in the app as long as possible. <br />
They don’t give a damn about users’ mental health or their time.

### I decided to make the complete opposite:
- No ADS
- No user profiles
- No views, likes and subscriptions
 
**The main feature:** only the blog owner can manage new posts.

Sounds unfair and boring, isn't it?)

The idea behind this project is to avoid distractions, unhealthy relationships, and to **focus on the owner’s news**. <br />
This is not entertaining place. This is the place where you get familiar with what's going on with the individual.
